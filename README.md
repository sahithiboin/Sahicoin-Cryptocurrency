# Sahicoin-Cryptocurrency
This project is about creating a cryptocurrency called "sahicoin" on a blockchain using flask and postman and performing transactions between 3 people. This project uses flask, javascript, python and postman as a UI to view the local blockchain.
## Steps to execute
* Complie and execute all python scripts. 
* Move on to postman UI and open 3 different tabs for transactions and use the specified url for each script to execute transactions and mine blocks accordingly.
* connect the nodes among the 3 before proceeding to transactions using the nodes.json
* transaction.json is used for proceeding with transactions.
* We need to use the "replace_chain" method in postman to replace the connected nodes in the blockchain network with the updated chain.
